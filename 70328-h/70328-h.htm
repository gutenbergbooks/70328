pie.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Mother. “You cannot
buy a pie without money.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Bobby. “I forgot
the money. I was going to be like
Simple Simon.”</p>

<p>“Simple Simon couldn’t buy a pie,”
said Betty. “He didn’t have a penny.”</p>

<p>“Can we buy a pie for a penny,
Mother?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Bobby. Pies cost more
than they did when Simple Simon
lived.”</p>

<p>“How much does a cherry pie cost,
Mother?” asked Betty.</p>

<p>Soon Bobby and Betty were at the
baker’s door.</p>

<p>They opened the latch and walked in.</p>

<p>“We shall have to wait until it is
our turn,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“How many are ahead of us?” asked

<p>Bobby and Betty counted very softly,
“One, two, three, four, five, six.”</p>

<p>“There are six ahead of us,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>While they were waiting, Bobby and
Betty looked at the show-case.</p>

<p>“That’s a chocolate cake,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“See those chocolate cookies,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“Where are the pies?” whispered
Bobby.</p>

see them on that shelf?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bobby. “I see them
now.”</p>

<p>“It’s our turn next,” whispered Betty.</p>

<p>“What will you have little boy?”
asked the baker.</p>

<p>“A cherry pie, please,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Here is a nice one,” said the baker.
“It is just out of the oven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“How much is it?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Eighteen cents,” answered the baker.</p>

<p>“Mother gave me twenty cents,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“Pies are eighteen cents today,” said
the baker. “What next?”</p>

<p>“That’s all Mother told us to buy,”
said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Eighteen, twenty cents,” said the
baker. “Here is your change. Is the
little girl your sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Bobby.</p>

<p>“Good day,” said the baker. “Who
is next?”</p>

<p>“Good day,” said Bobby and Betty.</p>

<p>“Let me carry the pie, Bobby,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>Betty took the pie, and Bobby held
the pennies in his hand.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you buy some chocolate
cookies?” asked Betty.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“Please, Bobby, please buy some
chocolate cookies!”</p>

<p>Bobby looked at the pennies.</p>

<p>He looked at the baker.</p>

<p>The baker was busy.</p>

<p>So Bobby put the pennies in his
pocket</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty then left the baker’s
shop and took the pie home to Mother.</p>

<p>At dinner Father said, “I like cherry
pie.”</p>

<p>“I like it,” said Mother.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“We are like blackbirds,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” asked
Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“Blackbirds they love cherry pie,”
said Betty.</p>

<p>“When did you learn that old song?”
asked Father.</p>

<p>“Last night,” answered Betty. “It’s
in my book.”</p>

<p>“There’s a pieman in my book,”
said Bobby. “Simple Simon met him.
Simple Simon wanted to buy a pie, but
he didn’t have a penny.”</p>

<p>“It takes money to buy a pie,” said
Father. “Simple Simon learned that.”</p>

<p>“If I meet a pieman, I’ll buy a pie,”
said Betty. “I’ll give him my penny
for a pie.”</p>

<p>“Are there any piemen now?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“Piemen do not walk the streets
now,” answered Father. “They sell pies
and cakes in shops.”</p>

<p>“Is the baker a pieman?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“We don’t call him a pieman,” said
Father, “but he makes and sells pies.”</p>

<p>“The baker sells bread, too,” said
Betty. “He sells rolls and buns.”</p>

<p>“Why does the baker wear a white
coat?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“He wants to keep clean,” said
Mother. “He wants to keep everything
in his shop nice and clean.”</p>

<p>“Bakers used to wear white aprons,”
said Father. “Bakers and piemen always
wore clean white aprons.”</p>

<p>“Where is the baker’s oven?” asked
Betty. “I didn’t see it.”</p>

<p>“It is in his kitchen,” answered
Mother.</p>

<p>“He must have a big oven,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“He has,” said Mother. “And he
has a long wooden shovel to take the
bread from the oven.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be a baker,” said Bobby.
“I’d like to have a baker’s shop and a
great big oven. I’d like to make pies and
cakes and muffins and bread and buns.”</p>

<p>“Let’s play we have a baker’s shop,”
said Betty. “Let’s play we are baking
bread in an oven. Let’s take the bread
from the oven with a long wooden
shovel.”</p>

<p>So Bobby and Betty played they were
bakers. They made an oven with their
blocks. And they made mud pies and
little cakes and put them in their oven.</p>

his rocking horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>So they put baby on the rocking
horse and gave him a nice ride.</p>

<p>Three times baby rode to the baker’s
shop before Mother came to put him
to bed.</p>

<p>Then Bobby and Betty went to the
bookcase and took out their Mother
Goose books.</p>

<p>“See, Father,” said Betty. “This is
the pieman.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Father. “That is
Colly-Molly-Puff.”</p>

<p>“What did you say, Father?” asked
Betty.</p>

<p>“Say it again, please,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Colly-Molly-Puff! Colly-Molly-Puff!”
repeated Father.</p>

<p>“Colly-Molly-Puff! Colly-Molly-Puff!”
repeated Bobby and Betty.</p>

<p>“That’s a funny name,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Is that the pieman’s real name?”
asked Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“No,” answered Father. “It’s a
nickname. Long ago the pieman was
called Colly-Molly-Puff.”</p>

<p>“Were all the piemen called Colly-Molly-Puff?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Not all,” answered Father. “One
was called Tiddy-doll and another was
called Gingerbread Harry.”</p>

<p>“What did Tiddy-doll and Gingerbread
Harry sell long ago?” asked
Betty.</p>

<p>“Cakes and pies,” answered Father.
“All these piemen went up and down
the streets calling out their wares.”</p>

<p>“Did they sell bread, Father?” asked
Bobby. “Did they sell muffins and rolls?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Father. “They sold
cakes and pies. The muffin man went
up and down the streets selling muffins
and rolls.”</p>

<p>“I know the muffin man,” said Betty.
“Here he is. See!”</p>

<p>“He is Colly-Molly-Puff’s brother,”
said Father.</p>

<p>“Were they real brothers?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Father. “They were
called brothers because one sold bread
and the other sold pies.”</p>

<p>“I wish they were here now,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s play they are,” said Betty.
“I’ll be the muffin man.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bobby. “I’ll be Colly-Molly-Puff.”</p>

<p>“O Daddy!” cried Betty. “I’m the
muffin man.”</p>

<p>“I’m Colly-Molly-Puff, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mother will dress you up,”
said Father.</p>

<p>“That will be fun!” cried Bobby and
Betty.</p>

<p>When Mother came in, she helped
them dress as Colly-Molly-Puff and the
muffin man. Then Father showed them
how to call out their buns and muffins
and cakes and pies.</p>

<p>“The dishes are washed,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, Father,” said Betty. “They
are washed and wiped and put away.”</p>

Father?” asked Betty.</p>

answered Father.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty drew up their chairs
and Father told them this story:</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, there was a very
good little boy, who always minded his
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“One morning his mother said to
him, ‘Take the broom and go and sweep
the steps.’</p>

<p>“Now the little boy did not wait for
his mother to tell him again. He took
the broom and went out and began to
sweep the steps.</p>

<p>“When he was sweeping, he heard
a noise.</p>

<p>“He looked all around to see what it
was, and what do you think he found?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“A penny! and it was on the step he
had been sweeping.</p>

<p>“‘O Mother, Mother!’ called the little
boy. ‘See what I have found!’</p>

<p>“‘A penny!’ said his mother. ‘You
have been a good boy. You may have
this penny for your very own.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, thank you, thank you!’ said
the little boy, and he went on with the
sweeping.</p>

<p>“While he was sweeping, the little
boy thought, ‘What shall I do with
this penny?’</p>

<p>“‘I have half a mind to buy some
dates. But no, I should have to throw
away the stones.’</p>

<p>“‘I will buy some apples. Oh, no,
I will not, for I should have to throw
away the cores.’</p>

<p>“‘I will buy some nuts. Oh, no,
for I should have to throw away the
shells.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“‘What shall I buy then? I will buy
some figs.’</p>

<p>“And so the little boy went to the
grocery store and bought a penny’s worth
of figs.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“That is all for this time,” said
Father.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice story,” said Betty.
“I’m glad the boy’s mother let him have
the penny.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Bobby. “I don’t

to spend.”</p>

<p>There were baskets of ripe red

“What can I do for you today?”</p>

<p>“I want some fresh eggs,” said
Mother.</p>

<p>“These are fresh from the country,”
said the groceryman.</p>

<p>“I will take two dozen,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Mother paid for the groceries, then

<p>Bobby and Betty helped Mother.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want, Mother,”
said Betty. “That will make a nice
grocery store.”</p>

<p>“Ba-na-nas! Ba-na-nas!” called the

<p>“Who is calling?” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“The banana man,” answered Betty.</p>

“Ba-na-nas! Ba-na-nas!”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask Mother if we can buy
some bananas,” said Bobby.</p>

some bananas.”</p>

buy today.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I do it?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Not this time,” said Mother. “It
is Betty’s turn today.”</p>

<p>Mother gave Betty thirty-five cents,
and she bought a dozen bananas.</p>

<p>The banana man then went down
the street calling, “Ba-na-nas! Ba-na-nas!
Ba-na-nas!”</p>

<p>Mother had bananas at dinner that
night.</p>

<p>Betty told Father about the banana
man, and Bobby told him about his
pushcart.</p>

said, “See if you can find the banana
man in your Mother Goose books.”</p>

the cherry woman.”</p>

cherries and oranges and lemons.”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” said Father. “Women
don’t sell fruit from wheelbarrows on our
streets.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Because that work is now done by
men,” Father answered.</p>

<p>“The banana man has a pushcart,”
said Bobby. “But the fruit and vegetable

<p>Bobby and Betty came in from their

<p>“What is it, Mother?” asked Bobby.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want you to go to the meat market

<p>“I’ll buy it,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Let me buy it,” said Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“You may buy the ham today,
Bobby,” said Mother. “Here is the

<p>Bobby and Betty went down the
street.</p>

<p>They were soon in front of the meat
market.</p>

<p>“O Betty!” cried Bobby. “Look at
those birds.”</p>

<p>“They are not birds,” said a lady.
“They are chickens.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty looked at the
chickens.</p>

<p>They were poking their heads out of
a cage.</p>

<p>“The chickens want to get out of
the cage,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I wish they were out,” said Bobby.
“I want to see them run.”</p>

<p>They went in and waited their turn.</p>

<p>Betty went to the closet off her

<p>“Now take your old shoes to the

</div>

<p>One day Bobby and Betty had a
party.</p>

<p>They played they were shoemakers
mending shoes.</p>

<p>All but Bobby sat down on the floor
so as to make a ring.</p>

<p>Then they sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rap-a-tap, tap! Tick-a-tack, too!</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>While they were singing Bobby came
into the room.</p>

<p>When they stopped singing, he said;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shoemaker, shoemaker, mend my shoe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have it done by half-past two.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” said the shoemakers. “We
will have it done by half-past two.”</p>

<p>Then the shoemakers worked and
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rap-a-tap, tap! Tick-a-tack, too!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This must be done by half-past two.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Soon Bobby came back and said,
“It is half-past two. Is my shoe
mended?”</p>

<p>“I have passed it to my next-door
neighbor,” answered the head shoemaker.</p>

<p>“Is my shoe mended?” asked Bobby
of the next-door neighbor.</p>

<p>“My next-door neighbor has it,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>Then Bobby asked the next child;
but he always got the same answer.</p>

<p>At last he saw who had the shoe,
so he asked the right one.</p>

<p>Then all the shoemakers called out:</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me!” said Mother
one night at bedtime when she looked
at Bobby’s shoes.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Mother?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“How do you wear out your shoes
so fast?” asked Mother. “These shoes
are not fit to wear.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take them to the shoemaker,”
said Bobby. “He’ll mend them.”</p>

<p>“They are past mending,” said Mother.
“You must wear your other shoes every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
day, and we will go to the shoe store and
buy a new pair.”</p>

<p>“May I have a new pair?” asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Let me see your shoes,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Betty came up close to Mother.</p>

<p>“Why, Betty!” said Mother. “Your
shoes are almost as badly worn as Bobby’s.”</p>

<p>“May I have a new pair, Mother?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Yes, Betty,” answered Mother. “We
will go to the shoe store tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The next day Bobby and Betty went
with Mother to the shoe store.</p>

<p>“Shoes for children,” answered Mother
when the salesman asked what he could
show her.</p>

<p>“What kind, Madam?” asked the salesman.</p>

<p>“Nice, soft shoes,” said Mother, “and
shoes that will wear well.”</p>

<p>“Their last shoes were nice and soft;
but they did not wear well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Children are rough with their shoes,
Madam,” said the salesman.</p>

<p>“Better get something heavier than they
have been wearing.”</p>

<p>“I want heavy shoes,” said Bobby.
“That’s the kind the big boys wear.”</p>

<p>“How do you like these, Madam?” asked
the salesman.</p>

<p>“They seem heavy for a child,” said
Mother.</p>

<p>“I like those shoes,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Let him try them on,” said the salesman.
“Let’s see how they fit. And let’s
see how this shoe fits the little girl.”</p>

<p>The salesman then took off one of
Bobby’s shoes and put a new shoe on
his foot.</p>

<p>He took off one of Betty’s shoes and
put a new shoe on her foot.</p>

<p>“Be sure the shoes are long enough,”
said Mother. “The children are growing
fast.”</p>

<p>“These are nice shoes,” said Betty.
“I like them.”</p>

<p>“I will take these shoes,” said Mother.</p>

<p>The salesman put the shoes in shoe
boxes and Mother paid him for them.</p>

<p>Mother then called Bobby.</p>

<p>“Play with baby, Bobby,” said
Mother. “Betty wants to go with me
to the dressmaker’s.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let Betty go,” said Bobby.
“Make her stay and take care of baby.”</p>

<p>“Betty will stay when you go with
Father to the tailor’s shop,” said Mother.
“You may go with Father when he
goes to the tailor’s.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Bobby. “I’ll stay
if I may go with Daddy.”</p>

<p>Mother and Betty went to the dressmaker’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>The dressmaker fitted Mother’s new
dress.</p>

<p>Betty thought Mother stood very
still while the dressmaker put pins in
her dress.</p>

<p>The dressmaker pinned and pinned
and pinned.</p>

<p>Betty thought she would never stop
putting pins in Mother’s new dress.</p>

<p>Betty sat very still.</p>

<p>She looked at the dresses in the
shop.</p>

<p>She was glad when Mother’s dress
was fitted.</p>

<p>“When may I have it?” asked
Mother.</p>

<p>“I will send it Saturday,” said the
dressmaker.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mother. “Be
sure to send the bill. I am glad you
can let me have the dress before
Sunday.”</p>

<p>When Father came in sight, Bobby
ran to meet him.</p>

<p>“When are you going to the tailor’s,
Daddy?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow morning,” answered
Father.</p>

<p>“May I go with you?” asked Bobby.
“Please, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“No, Bobby, there is nothing at the
tailor’s you want to see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to see, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“I want to see the tailor. I want to
see a man sew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, Bobby, you may go
with me.”</p>

<p>Bobby was up early next morning.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, he went
with Father to the tailor’s shop.</p>

<p>The tailor brought out Father’s new
suit.</p>

<p>Father tried it on.</p>

<p>Bobby thought Father stood very
still.</p>

<p>The tailor clipped the coat with his
sharp shears.</p>

<p>At first, Bobby thought he would
spoil it.</p>

<p>Bobby saw the tailor’s thimble.</p>

<p>He saw the tailor’s needle.</p>

<p>He saw his thread and beeswax.</p>

<p>He saw the tailor’s sewing machine,
and suits hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>At last the tailor said, “That’s all.”</p>

<p>“When will the suit be done?”
asked Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“I will send it Saturday,” said the
tailor.</p>

<p>“Send the bill with it, please,” said
Father.</p>

<p>Father then said “Good day” to the
tailor, and he and Bobby went out of
the shop.</p>

<p>“Run home, now,” said Father to
Bobby. “I must be off to my work.”</p>

<p>The tailor kept his word.</p>

<p>He sent Father’s suit and the bill
early Saturday morning.</p>

<p>An hour later Mother’s dress came
with the dressmaker’s bill.</p>

<p>Father liked his new suit.</p>

<p>Mother liked her new dress.</p>

<p>They paid the bills that very day.</p>

<p>So the tailor and dressmaker had
pay for their work.</p>

<p>And Father and Mother had their
new clothes to wear to church on Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon Father said, “Bobby
must have a new suit.”</p>

<p>“Will the tailor make it?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“No, Bobby. Mother will take you
to the dry-goods store. She will buy
you a ready-made suit.”</p>

<p>“That will be fine,” said Bobby.
“Let’s go now, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Today is Sunday, Bobby.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow will be Monday,” said
Bobby. “May we go Monday, Mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, we will go tomorrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>Just then Betty came in from play.</p>

<p>“Where are you going Monday afternoon,
Bobby?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mother and I are going somewhere.
You can’t go.”</p>

<p>“Betty may go with us,” said Mother.
“She needs a new dress.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Betty, “I’m going to
have a new dress. Shall we buy it of the
dressmaker, Mother?”</p>

<p>“No, dear. We don’t buy dresses at
the dressmaker’s. The dressmaker makes
dresses.”</p>

<p>“She made a pretty dress for you,
Mother,” said Betty. “I think she will
make one for me.”</p>

<p>“I can find a nice dress for you at
the dry-goods store,” said Mother.</p>

<p>“Is that the place where there are
pretty dresses in the window?” asked
Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>Monday afternoon Mother and the
children went to the dry-goods store.</p>

<p>A saleswoman came up to Mother and
said, “Madam, what can I show you?”</p>

<p>“Boys’ suits, please,” answered Mother.</p>

<p>The saleswoman led the way to the
place where boys’ suits were kept.</p>

<p>“I want one that will wear well,” said
Mother.</p>

<p>“I think you will like this,” said the
saleswoman. Bobby tried on the coat.</p>

<p>He liked it and Mother liked it.</p>

<p>“I will take it,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Mother then paid for the suit and
asked the saleswoman to send it.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see little girls’
dresses?” asked the saleswoman. “We
have some pretty ones.”</p>

<p>“If you please,” said Mother.</p>

<p>The saleswoman led the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>They soon came to the place where
little girls’ dresses were kept in the store.</p>

<p>Betty saw a dress with ruffles on the
skirt and a pretty sash.</p>

<p>“I like that,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty dress,” said Mother.
“May she try it on?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the saleswoman.</p>

<p>The saleswoman slipped the dress over
the one Betty had on.</p>

<p>Mother liked it and Betty liked it.</p>

<p>So Mother bought the dress for Betty.
And she bought cloth for an everyday
dress and for two everyday aprons.</p>

<p>The scissors-grinder took the scissors

<p>Then “Whir-r-r, whir-r-r, whir-r-r,”
went the grindstone. Sparks flew from

<p>Bobby and Betty stepped back. They
were afraid of the grindstone.</p>

<p>“Not today,” answered Mother.
“Please show us some hats for little
girls.”</p>

<p>“That is a pretty hat,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty, but it won’t wear well,”
said Mother.</p>

<p>“How do you like this hat?” asked
the milliner.</p>

<p>“That is better,” said Mother. “I like
the shape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“It’s very becoming,” said the milliner
when she put the hat on Betty’s head.</p>

<p>“How do you like it, Betty?” asked
Mother.</p>

<p>“I like it,” answered Betty.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice hat for a little girl,” said
Mother. “It will match your dress.”</p>

<p>“Will you buy it for me, Mother?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” answered Mother.</p>

<p>Mother paid the milliner for the hat.</p>

<p>The milliner put the hat in a paper
bag and handed it to Mother.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the milliner. “Come
in again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mother. “We shall
be glad to come again.”</p>

<p>On the way home, they stopped at a
candy store. Mother bought three sticks
of candy.</p>

<p>Then Mother and Betty went home
to Bobby and baby Billy.</p>

<p>Betty showed her new hat to Father.</p>

<p>“That’s a very nice hat,” said Father.
“Did Mother buy one for Bobby?”</p>

<p>“No, Daddy,” said Betty. “Mother
and I went to the milliner’s shop. The
milliner doesn’t have hats for boys as big
as Bobby.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Father. “Bobby can
get a good hat at the dry-goods store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“Won’t you take him there in the

<p>Bobby knew nothing about going until
the next morning.</p>

<p>Then Mother said, “Bobby, Father says
you may go with him this morning.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bobby. “That will be
fun. Daddy, where are we going?”</p>

<p>“To the dry-goods store,” answered
Father.</p>

<p>“Is that the store where I got my new
suit?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bobby,” answered Father. “We
will see if we can find a hat in the store
for a boy of your size.”</p>

<p>“It’s for me, Daddy, isn’t it?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“Have you been a good boy?” asked
Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“When Betty went with Mother to

<p>When Father and Bobby went into the

<p>The salesman showed Father and
Bobby the way to the place where boys’
hats were kept.</p>

<p>Bobby tried one on.</p>

</div>

<p>Bobby ran home with his new hat.</p>

<p>He showed it to Mother.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice hat for a little man,”
said Mother. “You are old enough now
to lift your hat when you meet a friend
on the street.”</p>

<p>“Why should I lift my hat, Mother?”
asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen always lift their hats,”
said Mother.</p>

<p>“Daddy does,” said Bobby. “I’ll ask
him to tell me about it.”</p>

<p>That night Bobby asked, “Daddy, why
do men lift their hats?”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Father. “I’ll tell you
about it.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty drew up their chairs.</p>

<p>“A long, long time ago,” said Father,
“there were knights who dressed in full
armor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve seen pictures of them,” said
Bobby. “Mother showed us a picture of
a knight in full armor.”</p>

<p>“In those days,” added Father, “it was
not safe for a knight to go out unless he
was dressed in full armor. But when a
knight was among his friends, he took off
his helmet.”</p>

<p>“Why did he take off his helmet?”
asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“He was among friends,” answered
Daddy. “It was safe to do it. And so when
a knight took off his helmet, he the same as
said, ‘I am in the presence of friends.’”</p>

<p>“That was a nice way to say it,” said
Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Father. “And a man
has a nice way of saying about the same
thing.”</p>

<p>“What is a man’s nice way of saying
the same thing, Father?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“It is by lifting his hat,” answered
Father.</p>

<p>“What does he say when he lifts his
hat?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“When a man lifts his hat, it’s a way of
saying, ‘I am in the presence of friends.’”</p>

<p>“That’s a good story,” said Bobby. “I
like it.”</p>

<p>“Put on your hat, my little man,” said
Father. “Play you are walking on the
street. Betty, play you are a friend.”</p>

<p>Bobby put on his hat and walked up
and down the room. Soon Betty met him.
Bobby lifted his hat as he passed her.</p>

<p>“Well done, young man,” said Father.
“Now tell me what you meant to say when
you lifted your hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes Father goes to the barber’s

<p>Sometimes Bobby and Betty go.</p>

<p>The barber cuts their hair.</p>

<p>One morning Father said to Bobby,
“Your hair is too long. You should
go to the barber and have him cut it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Betty’s hair should be cut,” said
Mother. “It is getting too long for a
little girl.”</p>

<p>“May we go to the barber today?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” answered Mother.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mother took the

<p>There was a big pole in front of

<p>“That is his sign,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>The barber met them at the door.</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty said, “How do
you do?”</p>

<p>“What can I do for you today?”
asked the barber.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Barber, I want my
hair cut,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I want my hair cut,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the barber. “Lay off
your things, children. Madam, be seated.
Here is a chair, little boy. Come, little
girl, sit in this big chair.”</p>

<p>Betty stepped forward and the barber
helped her get into the big chair.</p>

<p>He put a towel around Betty’s neck.</p>

<p>He took out a comb and a pair of
shears and began to cut Betty’s hair.</p>

<p>Betty tried to sit very still.</p>

curly hair.”</p>

<p>When Bobby took the chair, he
said, “I don’t want any curls.”</p>

are too big to have your hair curled.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask Mother if we can buy

<p>Bobby ran and Betty ran, but Betty
ran the faster.</p>

<p>“O Mother!” cried Betty. “Please
give me ten cents. I want to buy a
balloon.”</p>

<p>“Please give me ten cents,” said
Bobby. “I want to buy a red balloon.
Just look at it, Mother!”</p>

</div>

<p>“Listen!” said Bobby. “Is that the
band?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see,” said Betty.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty ran out to the street.</p>

<p>A hand-organ man was coming.</p>

<p>He had been playing up the street
and now was coming near.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and hear him play,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Betty.</p>

<p>So Bobby and Betty ran up the
street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>All the children in the block came
out.</p>

<p>Some of them danced and clapped
their hands while the hand-organ man
played.</p>

<p>The organ man kept looking up at
the windows.</p>

<p>“Here’s a nickel,” said a woman to
her little boy. “Take it to the hand-organ
man.”</p>

<p>The boy took the nickel to the organ-grinder.</p>

<p>He played another piece.</p>

<p>When this was played, Bobby said,
“Please play another. I’ll bring you a
penny.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty ran to the house and
Mother gave each of them a penny.</p>

<p>Bobby gave his penny to the hand-organ
man, and the man started to go.</p>

<p>“Play another piece,” said Betty.
“I’ll give you a penny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>Again the organ-grinder played.</p>

<p>Betty gave him a penny.</p>

<p>The organ-grinder went farther down
the street.</p>

<p>All the children followed.</p>

<p>When they came to the end of the
block, all but Bobby and Betty turned
back.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty stood still.</p>

<p>“It’s time to go back,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Let’s go a little farther,” said Betty.
“Mother won’t care.”</p>

<p>The organ-grinder started a lively
tune.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty forgot to go back
home.</p>

<p>They followed the organ-grinder.</p>

<p>On they went from house to house
after the organ-grinder.</p>

<p>Sometimes they skipped and danced
when the organ man played.</p>

<p>“This is fun,” said Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“It’s just like being grown up,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>So Bobby and Betty had a fine time
as long as the organ man played his
tunes.</p>

<p>When he stopped playing, they began
to feel tired.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” said Betty.</p>

<p>So Bobby and Betty turned back,
but they did not know the way home.</p>

<p>At first Mother did not miss Bobby

<p>She went to the door and called,
“Bob-by!”</p>

<p>Still there was no answer.</p>

<p>She went to the telephone and
’phoned to the policeman.</p>

<p>She told him Bobby and Betty were
lost.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Madam,” he said. “I’ll

Bobby and Betty, they were going on

<p>“I’m tired,” said Betty. “I want to
go home.”</p>

Betty, please. We’ll find Mother’s house,

<p>Just then the policeman met the

<p>Bobby and Betty were a long way
from home. But the policeman knew
the way.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we found you,” said Bobby.
“I’m glad you know the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Betty. “We lost
the way and we found you. And you
know the way.”</p>

<p>“Will you show us where Mother’s

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“Do you do anything else?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the policeman.
“I walk up and down the streets and take
care of the people.”</p>

<p>“Are you their father?” asked Betty.
“Are you the father of all the people on
the streets?”</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” answered the policeman.</p>

<p>“I know what you are,” said Bobby.
“You are a big brother. You are a
big brother to all of the people on the
streets.”</p>

<p>“Now you have hit it, my little man,”
answered the big policeman. “I try to
be a big brother to the people along
the streets.”</p>

<p>By this time it was almost dark, but
Bobby and Betty were now nearly
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know this street?” asked the

just around the corner.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty almost ran the last
few steps of the way.</p>

<p>They were soon at the door.</p>

<p>They could not wait for the policeman
to ring the bell.</p>

<p>They opened the door and ran straight
to Mother.</p>

<p>They threw their arms around her.</p>

<p>“O Bobby! O Betty!” cried Mother.
“I am so glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Mother thanked the policeman for

<p>“Tell me all about it,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty told Mother they
followed the organ-grinder. They told
her they skipped and danced to the music
the organ man played.</p>

<p>They told her they started home when

asked Mother.</p>

Mother, he is a big brother. I’m not afraid

him.”</p>

me, children, why did you follow the
organ-grinder beyond the end of this
block?”</p>

<p>“He played beautiful music,” said
Betty. “The music pulled us along,
Mother.”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Mother. “I
know how music pulls you along. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
my little ones must not let music pull
them away from home.”</p>

<p>“Next time it pulls, I’ll pull the
other way,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Bobby did pull a little,” said Betty.
“Next time I’ll help him and we’ll
come back to you.”</p>

<p>“That is right. Listen to the music
when the organ-grinder is in this block,”
said Mother. “When he goes to the
next block, it is time to pull away from
the music and come home to Mother.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we are home now,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“I wish you had been here this afternoon,”
said Mother. “You can’t guess
what you missed!”</p>

<p>“What was it, Mother?” asked Betty.</p>

<p>“Mrs. White came over with some
ice cream,” said Mother. “She had
more than she needed. She wanted you
to have some.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Did you save it for us?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>“I wanted to save it,” answered
Mother.</p>

<p>“Did you save the ice cream, Mother?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>“I had no way to keep it, children.
So I called in John and Josie, and they
ate the ice cream.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fudge!” said Bobby. “I wish
we had come home.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Betty. “I wish we
had turned back when John and Josie
did.”</p>

<p>“If we had turned back, we should
have had the ice cream,” added Bobby.</p>

<p>He leaves it on the back porch.</p>

<p>Sometimes Bobby brings it in to
Father.</p>

<p>Sometimes Betty brings it to him.</p>

<p>Father likes to read the paper before
he goes to his work.</p>

<p>One morning Father said to Bobby,
“Bring in the paper.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t come, Daddy,” answered
Bobby.</p>

<p>“The newsboy is late this morning,”
said Father.</p>

<p>“He is coming now,” said Betty. “I
see him.”</p>

<p>Bobby went out on the back porch.</p>

<p>The newsboy tossed a paper on the
porch and ran to the next house.</p>

<p>Bobby took the paper to Father.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bobby,” said Father.</p>

<p>“I want to be a newsboy,” said Bobby.
“Mother, may I be a newsboy?”</p>

<p>“What is that you are saying?” asked

<p>“I want to be a newsboy, Father,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“Betty, what do you think of that?”

Betty. “When Bobby is bigger he can
be a newsboy.”</p>

</div>

<p>Every day the postman comes with
mail in his mail bag.</p>

<p>He takes mail out of the mail bag
and puts it in the letter box.</p>

<p>He rings the bell and then goes on
to the next house.</p>

<p>When Bobby and Betty are at the
front door, the postman hands them their
mail.</p>

<p>When it is in the letter box, Mother
lets them take the key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>They unlock the box and take out the
mail.</p>

<p>Then one of them locks the box and
the other one takes the mail in to Mother.</p>

<p>One day Bobby asked, “Where does
the postman get the mail?”</p>

<p>“At the post office,” said Mother.
“The postmaster has men to sort the mail
and take it to the people.”</p>

<p>“Does the postmaster pay our postman?”
asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” answered Mother. “Uncle
Sam pays our postman.”</p>

<p>“Does Uncle Sam pay the postmaster?”
asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bobby,” answered Mother.
“Uncle Sam pays all the men who take
care of the mail.”</p>

<p>“Where does Uncle Sam get his
money?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“This is one way he gets money for
the work,” answered Mother. “Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
Sam sells postage stamps. Every time
we buy a stamp we help Uncle Sam
pay for carrying the mail.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that before,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Some day I’ll buy a postage stamp.
I’ll send a letter and help Uncle Sam.
I’ll help him pay his men who take

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_BOBBY_AND_BETTY_EARNED_MONEY">HOW BOBBY AND BETTY EARNED MONEY</h2>

</div>

<p>Bobby and Betty wanted to earn
money.</p>

<p>They wanted to buy roller skates.</p>

<p>So Mother said, “Save the old newspapers.
You may sell them to the junkman.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty saved the old newspapers.</p>

<p>They made neat bundles.</p>

<p>When they had three big bundles,
Mother said, “Now, children, you may
sell them.”</p>

<p>That very day Bobby and Betty heard
the junkman calling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“He’s coming,” cried Bobby. “The
junkman is coming.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty ran to the back
gate.</p>

<p>The junkman was driving nearer and
nearer, calling, “Pa-pers! pa-pers! Any
old pa-pers to sell?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” shouted Bobby. “We have
some old papers to sell.”</p>

<p>“Whoa! whoa!” called the junkman
to his horses.</p>

<p>The horses stopped at the back gate.</p>

<p>The junkman jumped down from his
wagon.</p>

<p>“This way,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>Bobby and Betty led the way to the
back door.</p>

<p>“Here are the bundles,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>The junkman had his scales in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Thirty pounds,” said he when he
weighed the first bundle of papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus93" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus93.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Forty pounds,” said the junkman
when he weighed the second bundle of
papers.</p>

<p>He then weighed the third bundle.
“Thirty pounds,” he said. “One hundred
pounds. I will give you twenty-five
cents.”</p>

<p>Bobby reached out his hand for the
money.</p>

<p>“Have you any bottles?” asked the
junkman.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Betty. “Here are
twelve bottles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“Three cents,” said the junkman, and
he handed the money to Betty.</p>

<p>“Anything else?” asked the junkman.</p>

<p>“That is all,” said Betty.</p>

<p>The junkman picked up his load and
took it out to the wagon.</p>

<p>“Gid-ap!” said the junkman to his
horses.</p>

<p>The horses started.</p>

<p>And again the junkman called out,
“Papers! pa-pers! Any old pa-pers to
sell?”</p>

<p>When the junkman had gone, Betty
said, “How much money do you have,
Bobby?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five cents,” answered Bobby.
“How much do you have?”</p>

<p>“Three cents,” answered Betty. “Give
me some of yours.”</p>

<p>Bobby looked puzzled. He knew
that part of the money was Betty’s. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
he did not know what to do with the
twenty-five cent piece he had.</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” said Mother.
“I’ll change the quarter. Then you and
Betty can divide your money.”</p>

<p>So Mother gave Bobby two dimes
and five pennies for his quarter.</p>

<p>Then Bobby and Betty worked and
worked.</p>

<p>At last they saw how to divide it.</p>

<p>“See, Mother,” said Bobby. “I have
fourteen cents.”</p>

<p>“I have fourteen cents, Mother.
See!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“That is a nice start,” said Mother.
“Put the money in your savings banks.
Then it will not get lost.”</p>

<p>“I want to earn more money,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what to do,” said
Mother. “Father has some old clothes
he doesn’t want to keep. You may sell
them to the old-clothes man.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Betty.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Bobby.</p>

<p>That very day the old-clothes man
came down the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus94" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

<p>“Any old clothes to sell? Any old
clothes to sell?” called the old-clothes
man.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried Bobby and Betty.</p>

<p>The old-clothes man came to the
back door.</p>

<p>“You may sell the suit,” said Mother
to Betty.</p>

<p>“Bobby, you may sell Father’s old
shoes.”</p>

<p>“Any men’s clothes?” asked the old-clothes
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Betty. “How much
will you give for this suit?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars,” said the old-clothes
man.</p>

<p>Betty looked at Mother.</p>

<p>“That is not enough,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Two dollars and a half,” said the
man.</p>

<p>Again Betty looked at Mother, and
again Mother shook her head.</p>

<p>“Three dollars,” said the old-clothes
man.</p>

<p>This time Mother nodded her head
to Betty, and Betty said, “You may
have it.”</p>

<p>Then the old-clothes man gave Betty
three dollars and asked, “Any men’s
shoes to sell?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bobby. “Here is
a pair.”</p>

<p>The old-clothes man looked at the
shoes. “Fifty cents,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>Bobby looked at Mother, then said
to the man, “That is not enough.”</p>

<p>“A dollar,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Take them,” said Bobby after he had
looked up at Mother.</p>

<p>The old-clothes man gave Bobby a
dollar for Father’s old shoes.</p>

<p>“Anything else?” asked the old-clothes
man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Betty. “Here is a
pair of ladies’ shoes.”</p>

<p>The old-clothes man looked at the
shoes and said, “Too small. Can’t use
them.”</p>

<p>“That is all we have to sell,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>The old-clothes man picked up the
old clothing and said, “Good day, good
day.”</p>

<p>“Good day,” said Mother and the
children. And the old-clothes man went
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>As soon as he had gone, Bobby
said, “I have a dollar. Betty how much
do you have?”</p>

<p>“Three dollars,” answered Betty.</p>

<p>“Give me a dollar,” said Bobby.
“Then we’ll each have two dollars.”</p>

<p>Betty looked puzzled. Then she said,
“Yes, that is right. Here is a dollar.
Now you have two dollars and I have
two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Mother, don’t we have enough to
buy roller skates?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“I think you have,” answered Mother.
“How much do you have in all?”</p>

<p>“I have two dollars and fourteen
cents,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“That is just what I have,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“I think we can get good skates
for that price,” said Mother. “We will
go to the hardware store this afternoon.
You may buy roller skates.”</p>

<p>“Is it time to go?” asked Bobby.</p>

it hard to wait?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bobby. “I can
hardly wait. I want to go to the hardware
store and buy roller skates.”</p>

<p>Soon Mother and the children were
on the way.</p>

<p>When they came to the hardware
store, they looked at the things in the
window.</p>

<p>“See!” cried Bobby. “See those
roller skates! That’s the kind I want.”</p>

<p>“That’s the kind John and Josie
have,” said Betty. “I like that kind.”</p>

<p>When they went in, the hardware

<p>“What can I show you, little boy?”
asked the man. “What can I show you,

<p>“Roller skates, please,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I want to buy roller skates,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“How do you like this skate?” asked

<p>Bobby shook his head.</p>

<p>“How do you like it, little girl?”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>While the hardware man was looking
for others, Mother asked, “What is
the matter, Bobby? What kind do you
want?”</p>

<p>“I want the kind where you get two
skates,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“I want that kind,” said Betty.</p>

<p>Mother bent down and whispered to
Bobby and Betty. You can guess what
she said.</p>

<p>When the hardware man came back
to them, Bobby asked, “What does a
pair like this skate cost?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars,” said the man.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a pair,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a pair just like Bobby’s,”
said Betty.</p>

<p>“Here is the money,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Here is the money for mine,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you,” said the
hardware man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>While he was wrapping up the

<p>“Why not put the money you have

Mother.</p>

Bobby.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ll do,” said
Betty. “I’ll keep my money in the

<p>Bobby and Betty had many a good

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUGGESTIONS_TO_TEACHERS">SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h2>

</div>

<p>It may be that supervisors and teachers of primary grades
have been looking for a book dealing with the occupations
in the neighborhood of a city child. The author of this book
looked for such a book years ago and found it not. So for
years materials have been accumulated for the preparation of
this reader. It is hoped that all who use it will enjoy it and
gain something of value from it. If the activities recommended
in the following pages are introduced, the work is
bound to prove a joy to teachers as well as to their pupils.</p>

<p><i>For study and play.</i> Each story is followed by related
rimes, riddles, and games which may be used in different
ways even by children of the same class. For instance, one
child may be able to read and memorize a rime which another
child finds difficulty in reading. The latter, however, can
read parts of the rime and find familiar words and phrases,
and when he hears the rime repeated in class the jingle of the
words is likely to stay with him and aid him in his second
attempt.</p>

<p>These old rimes and jingles are a part of the child’s social
heritage. They have come down through the centuries. It
is right that every child should become familiar with them and
enjoy their humor and rhythm. Nearly all of them are full
of action. Let children use them in dramatic play; let them
make drawings to illustrate points where they discover a
mental picture.</p>

<p>The riddles may be learned. The answers are given, for
children of the first grade rarely guess riddles. They love
them, however, and delight in repeating them for others to
guess.</p>

<p><i>Original poems by children.</i> In preparing the lessons it was
not difficult to find rimes and jingles of the old trades and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
tradesmen, but nothing could be found in folklore on the
newer occupations such as those of the iceman, laundryman,
grocer, garbage man, policeman, and newsboy. It did not
seem well to present these occupations without some appropriate
rime, so an appeal was made to children of primary
grades to assist the author by making rimes. Among those
sent in by their teachers six were selected, credit being given
in each case to the grade and school. Although the teachers
are not named, they are not forgotten.</p>

<p>The children who use this book can make verses and
should be encouraged to do so. Such compositions foster the
creative impulse found in every child in the pre-school period,
but too often atrophied through disuse on account of conditions
and methods not yet altogether out of date in our educational
system. Attention is called to the verses on the iceman
by a third grade in Hinsdale, Illinois, as being an example of
the excellent results which come from group work. Undoubtedly
no one of the children could have composed such verses
by himself. But under the impulse of a strong emotion and
through united effort they produced verses we all may enjoy.
Children of the first grade cannot be expected to produce
verses to equal these, yet it may not be impossible for them
to do so; at any rate, we all know that the youngest children
sometimes produce rare literary gems.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic play.</i> Let the children dramatize these lessons,
using their own experiences with the iceman, milkman, and
other workers as well as the materials given in the text. If
at first they act the story in pantomime, let them do so.
Young children have difficulty in the use of language and
can secure more rapid action by means of gestures and pantomime.
Such play develops clear mental pictures which
soon find expression in words. It is well to give children
freedom in dramatic play. Such freedom will not be abused
if responsibility is placed upon them and if an atmosphere is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
secured which promotes concentration. The first plays should
be very simple ones consisting of the action in one place.
Sometimes it may be the representation of Bobby and Betty
talking with their mother; again it may be at the baker’s
shop, and again on the way home. Children quickly discover
the natural divisions of a play and become interested in playing
the whole story and thus finding a way of representing different
scenes in an act. The dramatic play from day to day requires
nothing in the way of costume; but, if later it seems best
to represent a more finished play, the children will enjoy
planning and making simple caps, aprons, coats, and dresses
of paper or inexpensive material for the various characters.
A procession of workers will prove interesting, each child
representing one of the characters. Each one should be asked
to do something which the worker he represents might do,
whether it be the imitation of movements, an action song, or
repeating an appropriate jingle. A delightful entertainment
easily grows out of the work from day to day.</p>

<p><i>Games.</i> In addition to dramatic plays children should
play games. “Drop the Handkerchief” may be played in
connection with the postman; “Button, Button, Who Has
the Button?” and “The Needle’s Eye” to supplement lessons
on the dressmaker and the tailor; “Hunt the Slipper” while
the children are studying the shoemaker; “The Muffin Man”
and “Jack, Jack, the Bread’s a-Burning” in connection with
the baker. “What’s Your Trade?” may be adapted to any
one of the occupations and is played as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Children divide into two groups by choosing sides or by any
other arrangement. Children of the first group choose some occupation
they are to act in pantomime, but do not tell the second
group of children, for they are to guess it. When all are ready the
two groups approach each other from opposite sides of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Group.</span> Here we come. Here we come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Group.</span> Where from? Where from?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Group.</span> Milwaukee. Milwaukee. (The name of any
place the children may choose may be substituted for “Milwaukee.”)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Group.</span> What is your trade? What is your trade?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Group.</span> Watch and see. Watch and see.</p>

<p>Thereupon the children of the first group imitate the movements
of the occupation selected until some one of the second group
guesses it. Then the second group chooses an occupation for the
first to guess.</p>

</div>

<p>The teacher may modify this by letting one child act
an occupation for the class to guess. In such a case when he
appears the children may repeat:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here comes an old man from the wood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What can you do, old man?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Do anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children.</span> Work away.</p>

</div>

<p>The child who has the part of the old man or the old woman,
as the case may be, imitates the movements of some occupation
and the others guess it.</p>

<p><i>Songs.</i> Occupation songs are dear to young children and
should be used in connection with these lessons. Examine
the books accessible and make a list of the songs of the shoemaker,
baker, tailor, dressmaker, and other workers. At odd
moments many songs can thus be found. If it seems best,
enlist the coöperation of children and their parents in collecting
such songs.</p>

<p>Among the many books containing appropriate songs to
be used in this connection are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elliott, J. W. <i>Mother Goose Melodies.</i></li>
<li>Gaynor, Mrs. <i>Songs of the Child World.</i></li>
<li><span class="ditto">”</span> <span class="ditto">”</span> <i>Songs and Scissors.</i></li>
<li>Gomme, Alice B. <i>Children’s Singing Games.</i> 2 vols.</li>
<li>Hill, Mildred and Patty. <i>Song Stories for the Kindergarten.</i></li>
<li>Hofer, Mari Ruef. <i>Children’s Singing Games; Old and New.</i> 3 vols.</li>
<li>Neidlinger, W. H. <i>Small Songs for Small Singers.</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></li>
<li>Poulsson, Emilie. <i>Holiday Songs and Everyday Songs and Games.</i></li>
<li>Smith, Eleanor. <i>Songs for Little Children.</i></li>
<li><span class="ditto">”</span> <span class="ditto">”</span> <i>The Eleanor Smith Music Course.</i> Book Two.</li>
<li>Tomlins, William. <i>The Child’s Garden of Song.</i></li>
<li>Wiggin, Kate Douglas. <i>Kindergarten Chimes.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>If Book Two of the <i>Eleanor Smith Music Course</i> is at hand,
teach the children “The Fruit Vender” and “Street Sounds”
when studying the banana man, “Perrie, Merrie, Dixi” when
reading “Father Tells a Story,” “Shoe and Slipper” when
studying the shoemaker, and “The Concert” in connection
with the organ-grinder. The children’s song books listed above
contain many excellent songs of the occupations.</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i> Let the children use building blocks to
represent the baker’s shop with its show case and shelves
where he sells his bread and cake and pies. His kitchen, too,
is of great interest to children; if suitable arrangements can
be made, take the class to visit a baker’s kitchen. After
such a visit the baker’s kitchen and oven should be constructed;
the children will doubtless find ways of making bread tins
and long wooden shovels or paddles for taking bread from
the oven.</p>

<p>The project will not completely satisfy unless the baker
himself appears on the scene. Whether the toy baker shall
be fashioned from a clothes-pin, a piece of cornstalk, corn
husks, twigs, cloth, or wood may be left to the children, who
doubtless will be pleased to include in the dress the characteristic
white coat or apron and a white cap.</p>

<p>The shoemaker, and in fact all the characters included in
this book, may be treated in a similar way. If something
more permanent than block-building is desired, let the children
bring small dry-goods boxes or boxes of cardboard or
corrugated paper and fit them up for shops and stores. The
furniture for such toy shops can be made of blocks of suitable
size glued together, or by use of small cardboard boxes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
empty spools. Children are able to find ways and means
of making such furniture, but they should not be deprived
of the opportunity of seeing good forms made by others. At
this period in the child’s life finished workmanship is not the
aim. The product is of minor importance in comparison with
the activity itself and its place in developing clear mental
images.</p>

<p>Let the children mark out a familiar business street in their
sand box and indicate the location of the shops and stores,
which may be represented by small boxes. Of course, it will
not do to have the stores vacant and the streets deserted.
Tiny dolls may be made to represent the people, and tiny
pushcarts, wheelbarrows, milk wagons, and automobiles for
the street and alley. Larger pushcarts and wagons may be
made as separate projects from time to time, but in the one
under consideration everything must be on a small scale.</p>

<p>The milliner’s shop suggests the making of hats. Whether
these be simple hats for a toy milliner’s shop, dolls’ hats of
flowers of the season or other available material, or hats for
Simple Simon, Colly-Molly-Puff, the Rabbit Woman, or any
other character of the book, may be determined by the conditions
when the study is made. The making of hats, caps,
aprons, and other characteristic garments of the workers to
be used in dramatic play provides another form of interesting
and profitable work.</p>

<p><i>Drawing.</i> Each lesson presents suitable subjects for children’s
drawings. Use these day by day and encourage children
to look for pictures in the lines they read and to put them
on paper. One of the many interesting projects in connection
with the study, and one which may be preserved in a somewhat
permanent form, may be termed a group drawing of a street
showing the shops, stores, sidewalk, and street, together with
the people and vehicles. Such a group drawing may be made
in sections and later placed on the wall so as to form one large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
continuous picture. If preferred, paper-cutting may be used
instead of drawing, and the objects pasted on large sheets.
Such illustrations have been made by primary classes with
excellent results.</p>

<p><i>Ethical ideas.</i> Children readily understand the importance
of honesty in weights and measures as well as in making
change. They also know that their mothers prefer to buy
groceries of a grocer whose store is clean and orderly and
whose stock is of excellent quality. They can easily understand
that the groceryman must understand his business,
know how and what to buy as well as how to keep his stock
in good order and sell it in a businesslike way. They will
be interested in learning what each of the workers does for
the community and what we as members of the community
do for each in return for his service. They will learn to respect
and honor the efficient and faithful worker and, it may be,
even at this early age, get a glimpse of why it is that some do
not succeed. Ethical ideas should not be forced upon the
children, but can be brought out in their dramatic play and
other activities. In such ways teach the children the value
of cleanliness, order, intelligence, honesty, promptness, and
fidelity, not only to the worker, but to the community as a
whole.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
